      <p>
        I am a junior at Xavier University of Louisiana and majoring in Computer Science and Spanish.
        Computer Science, because I love creating and designing new things. Spanish, because I love languages
        and cultures (I can't wait to learn more about the world)! Once I graduate, I would like to work as a
        User Experience Designer so that I can help people through my visual designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interests include painting, dwaring, playing instruments and traveling. I have always been invloved
        in art and music in grade school and college. I played in the ensemble for two years here at Xavier plan
        to continue doing so once conditions better.
